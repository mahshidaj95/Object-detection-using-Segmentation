# Object detection using Segmentation
In this repository, we use an image containing coffee beans as an input. For detecting, we use Opencv package in Python.

After running detect.py program, in the result.jpg image all coffee beans are detected by bounding boxes and every single coffee bean saved as an .jpg image.
